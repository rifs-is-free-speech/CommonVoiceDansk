# CommonVoiceDansk

This is an adapter that can make the rifs-CLI work with the CommonVoice data
without fuss. 

Common Voice is a publicly available voice dataset, powered by the voices of
volunteer contributors around the world. People who want to build voice
applications can use the dataset to train machine learning models.


At present, most voice datasets are owned by companies, which stifles
innovation. Voice datasets also underrepresent: non-English speakers, people of
colour, disabled people, women and LGBTQIA+ people. This means that
voice-enabled technology doesnâ€™t work at all for many languages, and where it
does work, it may not perform equally well for everyone. We want to change that
by mobilising people everywhere to share their voice.

The danish subset of CommonVoice is 12 hours of annotated speech. This is what
we call [CommonVoiceDansk](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/da/datasets)

## Intended use

This can be used for both training and testing.
